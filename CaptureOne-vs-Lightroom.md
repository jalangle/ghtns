title: Capture One vs. Lightroom

This page is a work in progress as I play with the Capture One 22 trial.

# Thougts on Capture One v Lightroom

As of 2020/05/26

Capture One version used: Capture One 22
Lightroom version used: Lightroom CC

## Cost
Capture One - $25 per month, $180 annual, $300 perpetual
Lightroom - $10 per month photographers

Capture One perpetual is 30 months of Lightroom CC photographers subscription with 1TB of storage.  Lighrtoom Classic would be a better comparison but no longer appears to be available to purchase
without subscription.

## Things I like specifically about Capture One

- Multi-window functionality.
- Customizability of the tool panes.
- Smart Albums
- Before|After slider

## Things I don't like specifically about Capture One

- Hiding too much behind drop downs
- Inability to put tool panes on both sides of the window.  I like the lightroom CC setup with
asset management on the left and editing on the right.  The Capture One one-window solution puts
everything on one side or the other.  Can work around with a multi-window solution but its a bit
awkward.
- Performance
- Inability to import a Lightroom CC library
- Browser Window & headers in specific views.  If sorting by date, I'd like a header at each date.  Or maybe a "calender" view...

## Things I like specifically about Lightroom

- The multi-device support. Moving between Mac & iPad & iPhone letting me accomplish various tasks.

## Things I don't like specifically about Lightroom

- Subscription.
- The sync.  Slow & frequently gets stuck.
- Storing everything remotely by default.  Saves me space locally but not actually what I want.
