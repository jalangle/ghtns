title: Capture One vs. Lightroom

This page is a work in progress as I play with the Capture One 22 trial.

# Thougts on Capture One v Lightroom

As of 2020/06/01

Capture One version used: Capture One 22
Lightroom version used: Lightroom CC

## Cost
Capture One - $25 per month, $180 annual, $300 perpetual
Lightroom - $10 per month photographers

Capture One perpetual is 30 months of Lightroom CC photographers subscription with 1TB of storage.  Lighrtoom Classic would be a better comparison but no longer appears to be available to purchase
without subscription.

## Things I like specifically about Capture One

- Multi-window functionality.
- Customizability of the tool panes.
- Smart Albums
- `Before|After` slider

## Things I don't like specifically about Capture One

- Hiding too much behind drop downs
- Inability to put tool panes on both sides of the window.  I like the lightroom CC setup with
asset management on the left and editing on the right.  The Capture One one-window solution puts
everything on one side or the other.  Can work around with a multi-window solution but its a bit
awkward.
- Performance is laggy
- Inability to import a Lightroom CC library
- Browser Window & headers in specific views.  If sorting by date, I'd like a header at each date.  Or maybe a "calender" view...
- Haven't yet figured out an import direct from camera solution. 

## Things I like specifically about Lightroom

- The multi-device support. Moving between Mac & iPad & iPhone letting me accomplish various tasks.
- Regular feature updates. CC still lacks so much functionality from classic that this not existing would be a really really bad sign.

## Things I don't like specifically about Lightroom

- Subscription.
- The hard push on social. I don't want the "Discover" or anything about it to ever show up but can't turn it off.
- Lack of multi-catalog support. The fact I can't separate my birding photos from everything else drives me up a wall. The "you don't need multiple catalogs" crowd just go away on this topic. 
- The sync.  Slow & frequently gets stuck (I've had 2 stuck for ages and Lightroom won't / can't tell me which.)
- Storing everything remotely by default.  Saves me space locally but not actually what I want.
- UI gets easily confused.  If you have previously set albums to be stored locally but then check the checkbox for storing a copy of all originals you still get the green checkmark for some but not for everything.  And there doesn't appear to be a way to set the "store this locally" on an album after the fact.
- Lack of smart albums
- Should be able to tag people even when lightroom doesn't detect the people
- The current UI for asset "versions"
- Feature platform separation. There are features that are only available on one platform or another, not on all.
- Keyword's seem half-implemented.  Can't find a way to see a keyword cloud or a search other than to sortof know a keyword exists.
