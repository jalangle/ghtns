Title:The Big Cats of Milwaukee County Zoo
---

## Overview

I’m in Milwaukee for a concert with a coworker and decided to renew my acquaintance with [Milwaukee County Zoo (MCZ)](http://milwaukeezoo.org) as an opportunity to practice my photography. 

I have an impression of Milwaukee County Zoo as a fantastic zoo from school field trips during my youth. If you asked details about the zoo, however, before yesterday I wouldnt have been able to give any. 

The big cats were the highlight for me in this trip. They were engaged and moving about and frequently striking poses. The indoor space, while poor for photography, had interesting light & shadow. It made for some interesting attempts at portraits. 

## Bullet Points

*The Good*
- The facilities were clean, the paths wide and well maintained.
- Many of the animals seemed active and engaged.
- The big cats were gorgeous
- I was glad to see what appeared to be signs of constant renovation. The giraffe barn appeared to be newer, and the elephant yards had a very new exhibit feel and style to them. The hippo area is currently under construction.
- Primate facilities are clearly invested in. I was disappointed to find the gorilla areas closed off but the bonobos seemed out and about. 
- There still are some “night” areas for bats and other lovely creatures. These seem to be disappearing from zoos, much to my disappointment. 


*The Not So Good*
- Pretty much anything indoor felt dark and a bit stuffy
- Guests were disappointing. First, child in a school group pulled a fire alarm in one building while I was there. Second, parents were so busy not paying attention they were letting children climb almost into exhibits in the bird house even with clear signage about not climbing. I got to commiserate with a docent who had to follow one family around while the adults talked and let their children run wild while the docent tried to keep them from bothering animals.
- I could have used more frogs and snakes, less fish.
- Small mammals was disappointing; it may have been halloween decorations or just an attempt to give critters enrichment but many enclosures felt stuffed with human goods.

## Summary

Would definitely return.
