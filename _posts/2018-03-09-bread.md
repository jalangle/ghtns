6. turn out of rising bowl, punch down, form and put in 1.5lbs bread pan
7. let rise for another 45 minutes

Baked for 1 hour @ 350 with fan.

Loaf turned out well baked and airy but fairly short due to the pan size.  Should have used a 1lbs pan.  Got a good
crust.  Crumb density was clearly heavier at the bottom of the loaf.
