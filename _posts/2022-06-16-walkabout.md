Title: Walkabout in Lower Queen Anne
---

Went for a short walk through the area bounded by Prospect St, Mercer St, 99 and Queen Anne Ave. I
think I may have found a couple spots for Seattle Landmark photographs that are going to be close
to a familiar perspective but slightly different.  Need to be a bit careful of overhead wires so
the wide angle shots aren't always great but may be able to get some interesting close-ups.
