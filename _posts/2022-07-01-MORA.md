Trip was 5 days in Mount Rainier National Park.

Weather on this trip was not particularly cooperative. There were more than seventy inches of snow at Paradise still, upon arrival. Two days had some sun. Two were mostly rainy.  There was lots of
evening cloud and fog; only one clear night for astro.

Stops on this trip include but are not limited to:
- Carter Falls,
- Christine Falls,
- Longmire,
- Madcap Falls,
- Narada Falls,
- Paradise,
- Reflection Lakes,
- Sunbeam Creek.

The original plan for the trip was to be able to hike around Paradise and look at meadows and the mountain from various angles.  Due to snow levels, a backup plan was developed around beginning some
astrophotography efforts.  A week out, this plan looked untenable due to weather forecasts so a
backup backup plan of "just get whatever looks interesting" arose.  This ended up being mostly
waterfalls and exploring some new areas to gain familiarity.

The final product of the trip included a few sets of astro photos to work on from the single clear night, a few waterfall photos, and some miscellaneous landscape.  Nothing outstanding but a partial
success none the less.
