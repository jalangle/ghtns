A follow up to the [Data Usage]({% post_url 2018-10-13-data-usage %}) post.  Here's how the rest of the month went.

|  Date | Used  | Monthly Avg per Day | Avg since last data point |
| ----- | ----- | ------------------- | --------------------------|
| 10/10 | 488GB | 48.8GB              | 48.8GB                    |
| 10/12 | 565GB | 47.1GB              | 38.5GB                    |
| 10/15 | 620GB | 41.3GB              | 18.3GB                    |
| 10/19 | 662GB | 34.8GB              | 10.5GB                    |
| 10/31 | 939GB | 30.3GB              | 23.3GB                    |

The only change made to the networking config this month is the speed test check box. The
household viewing habits haven't varied much.

Happily, the 939GB is under the 1024GB cap so I retain 1 courtesy month of overage just in
case I go over again in the future.
