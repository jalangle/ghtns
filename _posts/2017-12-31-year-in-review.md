## Life events

### Burglery
My apartment in Fremont got burgled.  Lost many small electronics, laundry quarters, a pocket knife. That led directly to the next bit which is.

### Home purchase
I bought a house. Larger than I actually need but its nice for having visitors in the future.

### Change in site (wordpress => github pages)
For the first time since I started hosting my own site, I'm moving away from [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/). Its a useful piece of software but heavy weight for the things I need.  Instead, using github pages.  We'll see how that goes.  If it ends up not being quite what I need from a customization perspective, then I'll look at running a static site generator directly on AWS I think.
