I don’t have much to say about myself and I’m not much into self-aggrandizement. So we’ll leave it with the basics.

I’m a software developer in the Pacific Northwest with hobbies like hiking and photography.  In the past I've enjoyed 
learning about cooking, home brewing, collecting liquor (mostly scotch), and skeet shooting.

If you want to know more, I’m sure you can dig up my contact info.
