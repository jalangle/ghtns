# Thoughts

4 mile auto loop tour.  Summer you can leave vehicles but the rest of the year is inside the vehicle. Great for birding.

There's a bird blind near mile 1.25 and a 1.5 mile walking trail near mile 1.5.  The bird blind is not terribly useful in the summer; its
grassed in.  It does, however, tend to have barn swallow nests and the trees around it frequently have flycatchers.  

The trail is bug heavy but has some lovely grassland views.
