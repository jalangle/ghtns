Spend some time in the Pioneer Square area seeing some combination of **King Street Station** after the restoration is finished, the **Underground Tour**, the **Gold Rush Museum**, and **Waterfall Garden Park**. These are easy to do and a stones throw from the Mariners and SeaChickens/Sounders stadium if you want to try and be in the area
