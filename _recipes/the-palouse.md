I went to [the Palouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palouse) with folks from a local photography group. It was my
first expedition to the East side of Washington as more than just transiting through.

Trip itinerary turned out to be something like this...

Saturday: leave early, brunch at the [Yellow Church Cafe](http://theyellowchurchcafe.com), then drive through Potholes
State Park as well as Columbia National Wildlife Refuge. Take some photos at Palouse Falls State Park in the afternoon. 
Then drive to Dayton, WA to check into the hotel. Drive back to Palouse Falls in the evening to take more photos and
stay late to get some early night photos. Leave around 21:30 because just too tired.  Dinner was at [Rays Drive 
In](https://www.yelp.com/biz/rays-drive-in-dayton) which cleared my bar of tastiness.

Sunday: drive all over the region looking for interesting things. Rough trip for my vehicle was Dayton to Colfax,
Colfax to Palouse, Palouse to Rosalia, Rosalia to [Steptoe Butte State Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steptoe_Butte), 
then back to Dayton.  Got to see [Kamiak Butte County Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamiak_Butte) and [Steptoe
Battlefield State Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steptoe_Battlefield_State_Park) as well. Breakfast was at the
hotel, lunch at the [Palouse Caboose](https://www.palousecaboose.com) for lunch which was pretty good and dinner was
food out of the cooler in the car.

Monday: get up, drive to Walla Walla for breakfast at the [Maple Counter Cafe](https://maplecountercafe.com), and then
drive home.  Lots of traffic made for a mess.  Nelson Siding Rd turned out to be a surprisingly useful exit since the
[Lavendar Lake Public Access](https://wdfw.wa.gov/places-to-go/water-access-sites/30288) has a pit toilet.

As for photography, post-harvest in the Palouse turns out to not be my favorite time & place to be.  The color
palatte is a lot of yellow and brown and harvested fields were either stubble or waiting to be tilled over.  I found
it hard to pick lines that stood out to me as interesting.

I got maybe 3 or 4 photos out the trip that I'm happy with.

Some thoughts for the next trip:
- Plan differently so that I can take decent night photos.  Related: take a night photo class.
- Plan to spend some more time in the small towns.  Rosalia, Palouse and Oakesdale all had some interesting buildings.
- Go in a different time of year.  Probably spring.  One of the locals suggested winter is actually very picturesque
but I don't know that I want to drive over the passes with snow on the ground if I don't have to.
- Actually camp at Palouse Falls.  The sites aren't great but having tent & napping in afternoon would have made it 
easier to stay up late to get night photos.
