# Attempt #1

## Task
- Smoke a brisket.

## Goals
- Temp control on the BGE
- decent smoke

## Materials
- 15lbs packer brisket purchased from CostCo
- salt
- lump charcoal
- hickory chips for smoking

## Method
- Trimmed cap & separated into flat & point.
- Salted brisket well.  No rub applied which is a bit horrible but fine for my first attempt. 
- Put on BGE at roughly 250F, indirect heat, with hickory wood chips for smoking.  

## Observations
- took about 45 minutes to bring BGE up very slowly to the temp I wanted.  Was very careful not to
overshoot and have been checking temp every 10-15 minutes.
- On at 0830.  Off at 1700.  Internal temp of flat was 197.  Internal temp of point was about 193.
- Pulled off grill to rest and covered with foil on small sheet pan.

## Results
- meat was a bit over done.  Not horrible but not super moist.
- a clearly observable smoke ring.
- for nothing more than salt, its pretty tasty on its own.
- day after is perhaps better.  A bit of time cooling allowed some of the extra tough bark to
soften.

# Attempt #2

## Materials
- BGE lump charcoal
- Hickory & Cherry chunks
- 15lbs packer brisket from Costco
- [Central Market](http://central-market.com/) house blend barbecue rub
- Bone Broth

## Method
- Trim up the brisket.  Separate the point & the flat.
- Inject both liberally with a mixture of bone broth and beef broth
- Coat liberally with the rub (moisture from injection worked well to adhere)
- Smoke for 6 hours between 225 and 275.
- Wrap in foil and put back on grill for another 2 hours.
- Unwrap and let the bark dry back out.
- Cube the point, toss them in sauce made from drippings out of foil, [Sweet Baby Rays](https://www.sweetbabyrays.com/Sauces/Barbecue-Sauces/Original-Barbecue-Sauce) and [Hak's Habanero Pineapple](https://haks.com/products/hak-s-habanero-pineapple)
- Put cubes back on grill for roughly an hour at low temp while flat rested.

## Observations
- The burnt ends turned out well.
- The flat was definitely better than the last brisket attempt.

## Results
Shareable. Not where I want to be but not embarassed by it.
