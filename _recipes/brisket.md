## Task
- Smoke a brisket.

## Goals
- Temp control on the BGE
- decent smoke

## Materials
- 15lbs packer brisket purchased from CostCo
- salt
- lump charcoal
- hickory chips for smoking

## Method
- Trimmed cap & separated into flat & point.
- Salted brisket well.  No rub applied which is a bit horrible but fine for my first attempt. 
- Put on BGE at roughly 250F, indirect heat, with hickory wood chips for smoking.  

## Observations
- took about 45 minutes to bring BGE up very slowly to the temp I wanted.  Was very careful not to
overshoot and have been checking temp every 10-15 minutes.
- On at 0830.  Off at 1700.  Internal temp of flat was 197.  Internal temp of point was about 193.
- Pulled off grill to rest and covered with foil on small sheet pan.

## Results
- meat was a bit over done.  Not horrible but not super moist.
- a clearly observable smoke ring.
- for nothing more than salt, its pretty tasty on its own.
- day after is perhaps better.  A bit of time cooling allowed some of the extra tough bark to
soften.
