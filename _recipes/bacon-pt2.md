title: Bacon, Part 2
---

## Task
Smoke the cured bacon

## Observations
Fairly salty.  Probably could have cured twice as much meat in the mixture and been fine. The end
result is probably better for cooking with (carbonara, diced bacon bits in omlettes) than eating as
strips with breakfast.

## Method

Smoked bacon at about 220 for roughly 90 minutes (150F internal temp).  Used a mix of hickory and
cherry wood
