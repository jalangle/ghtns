title: Home Grown Grape Jelly
---

The back yard has a grape of unknown variety. Having tried the grapes off the vine a few weeks ago
they have a fairly large pair of seeds with (to me) fairly thick skin accompanying a more tart than
sweet flavor profile.

Now that its the rainy season in the Pacific Northwest, I spent some time pulling grapes off the
vine and wasn't sure what to do with them.  So I made grape jelly.

## Steps
1) About 1.5 lbs of grapes to a large pot with water maybe an inch up under the grapes to help get
the cooking started.

2) Use a potato masher and to intermittently press the grapes and turn the whole thing into a big
pulpy mash.

3) Once everything is pulped (and very aromatic), strain the juice off the pulp. I just used a
strainer. The pulp wasn't very fine. Press the pulp in the strainer to make sure all the juice is
out.  After this step, I had about 2.5cups of juice.

4) Add 3TBSP pectin, bring to a hard boil, stirring constantly

5) Add 2.25c granulated sugar, bring back to a hard boil and let it boil for one minute, still
stirring constantly.

6) Take off heat and put in mason jars.  Put on a lid. Let set overnight.

If you wanted the jelly to last longer, you could process it via a standard canning process.  I
wasn't sure how good it would be so didn't take the time.  Depending on the number of grapes the
vine produces next year, I will.

One thing to note; if I do this again, I'll probably reduce off about half a cup of water from the
juice over fairly low heat in between steps 3 and 4.  The jelly set decently but I'd like it just a
touch firmer and the water added in step 1 can go away.
